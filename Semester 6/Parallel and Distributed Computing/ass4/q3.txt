Step by step breakdown of the program's work flow:

(1) Initializes MPI environment and retrieves the rank and size of the processes.
(2) Initializes an integer array "data" with 10 elements and values {7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 7, 3, 6, 0, 9}.
(3) If rank is 0, initializes the "data" array with values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
(4) Uses MPI_Scatter to distribute each element of "data" array to each process.
(5) Computes the sum of each process's data element and reduces it to a single value using MPI_Reduce with MPI_SUM operation.
(6) Uses MPI_Scan to compute the scan operation (prefix sum) of the sum values among all processes.
(7) Uses MPI_Bcast to broadcast the scan results from the last process to all other processes.
(8) If rank is 0, prints the original "data" array size, sum, and the scan results for each process.

Expected output:

Data size: 10
Sum: 45
Scan result at rank 0:0
Scan result at rank 1:0
Scan result at rank 2:1
Scan result at rank 3:3
Scan result at rank 4:6
Scan result at rank 5:10
Scan result at rank 6:15
Scan result at rank 7:21
Scan result at rank 8:28
Scan result at rank 9:36
